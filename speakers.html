        <p class="fs-5 text-muted subhead">President & Co-Founder, It’s Never 2 Late</p>
        <p>Jack York is co-founder of It’s Never 2 Late (iN2L), a company dedicated to helping older adults realize the full benefits of adaptive technology. Originally, Jack did not envision iN2L as a business; the impetus for what became the company was a philanthropic idea—to donate computers to assisted living communities and nursing homes in Southern California. With a 15-year background in the Silicon Valley, he saw a vast potential in fostering these connections, but also saw that conventional technology was too difficult for virtually all residents to use in a meaningful way. As a result, in 1999, Jack retired as Vice President of Strategic Sales for Vishay Intertechnology and started what has become a successful gerontechnology company. He is a sought-after national and international speaker on technology being used as a means to create personalized experiences that engage and connect residents to their loved ones and the world at large, specifically individuals with dementia. As of 2018, the company has a customer base of over 2,500 communities spread out across all 50 states. iN2L’s work has been recognized by the Wall Street Journal, NPR, and dozens of senior living publications.</p>
